The dataset we will be working with in this project is called "Top Spotify Tracks of 2018" from Kaggle. This dataset includes numerous quantitative variables as well as some qualitative variables that include the song title, artist, and the Spotify url id. The quantitative variables are slightly less intuitive, including danceability, energy, key, loudness (in dB), mode, speechiness, and acousticness. Most of these quantitative variables range from 0 to 1, where 1 is the highest measure and 0 indicates a low value. Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. Speechiness is how often words are present in the song, and mode indicates the modality, which is whether the song is major (1) or minor (0).

We will be using PCA and clustering analysis in order to find an interpretable structure of the data in order to gain understanding of music popularity in 2018. We will be using PCA to reduce the number of dimensions. From here, we will explore k-means, hierarchical, and model-based clustering to analyze the data and see what relationships occur between the variables.
